## Setting up development environment
This application requires a Python 3 interpreter.

To build the application, start a virtual environment using `venv`:
```
python3 -m venv env
source ./env/bin/activate
python install -r requirements
```
Pip will install all the required packages, and you should be able to start the application:
```
python main.py
```
